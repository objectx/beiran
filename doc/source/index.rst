Beiran is a set of tools for replacing distribution layer
of package management systems.

.. warning:: At this moment, it is under heavy development and we will be
 announcing an alpha release soon.

It aims provide out-of-box experience to fit along with
existing tools, focuses on security, decentralization and availability. Beiran
creates a cluster of nodes on an underlying p2p network to share ``packages``.
Package refers to any binary objects like docker images or layers, deb or tar archives.

Beiran ``package`` plugins allows cluster to manage packages of many systems like
docker, apt, npm or pip. By version alpha, only docker, apt and npm
systems will be supported. We expect to support more with help of community. If you
are interested in starting a plugin, please follow our
:doc:`contribution guide </contribute>` document.
